EFIPWN is an EFI image parser which can dissect EFI Firmware Volumes.
The three main usecases are printing the structure of an image,
dumping the contents into a filesystem structure and generating an
FDF file for regeneration of an image using the EDK2 buildsystem.

Before using this code, you need to setup the EDK2 buildsystem and
change the path of the LZMACompress binary in EFI.py line 389.

The code is not very failsafe but in most cases it works fine.
